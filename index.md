# Welcome To Swift

## What is Swift?

Swift can be described many ways.
Formally it is a "compiled, statically typed, object oriented language".
More casually, it is a language developed by Apple for people building for their platforms, e.g. iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS.


Apple introduced us to Swift in June 2014.
At that time they described it as “Objective-C” without the C.
So what is Objective-C?
Objective-C is an object oriented variant of C, and prior to 2014 it was the primary programming language for iOS and OS X.


So, when Apple said that Swift was “Objective-C without the C”, they were saying it has all the power of Objective-C but with a more modern syntax and updated language features.
At the time, this was evidenced by the tight relationship between the two languages.
All of the old libs Apple had written for Objective-C were available to us in Swift, and, we could compile our old Objective-C code and our Swift code right alongside each other in the same app.


In December of 2015, Apple open sourced Swift.
The code used to build the Swift compiler and its peripherals are available to the public.
Apple also published [Swift.org](https://swift.org) which serves as a roadmap for Swift’s development and resources for developers and contributors.

## Where do I get Swift

### Mac Users

If you are a Mac user, Swift is comes built in.
You can open a terminal and type `swift` and hit enter to start a Swift REPL.
Here you can type Swift code and see the results of its execution.

To take full advantage of the language you'll want to install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
Xcode is an IDE for Swift which contains all the tools you'll need to build applications.
Xcode also offers [interactive playgrounds](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=35) which is a handly tool for prototyping and playing around with the Swift programming language.

### iOS Users

iPad users can download the [Swift Playgrounds](http://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) iOS app.
This app includes some interactive puzzles that are solved by writing Swift code.

### Linux Users

Linux users can also use the Swift programming language.
[Swift.org](https://swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift) has some information about installing Swift on a system running Linux.

### Windows Users

## Language Features

Let's review some of Swift's syntax and language features.

This review of language is by no means comprehensive.
Check out [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html) for a more thorough overview of the language.
